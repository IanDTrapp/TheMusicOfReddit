<h2>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>In part two, I examine common users between musical subreddits. Much like part one, I used Python! I wrote a script to fetch the comments from the top 50 posts of all time from each subreddit (list can be found <a href="/TheMusicOfReddit/genres">here</a>). I found common users between the subreddits and determined graph edge weights by counting common users. It may seem like 50 is a low sample size, but some of the posts have over a thousand comments and, in my experience, the process for grabbing comments cost more time than the process for grabbing post titles using this API.</p>

<h2>
<a id="methodology" class="anchor" href="#methodology" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methodology</h2>

<p>My methodology here is very similar to the first part. I fetched the top 50 submissions from each subreddit, grabbed every comment from them, and saved the 'author' attribute. I then filtered out errors (posts that had been deleted, for example) and condensed my data in to a dictionary where the users are the keys, and their respective subreddits are their values. I imported this data in to Gephi to visualize it, and I've posted my representation below.</p>

<p><a href="https://gephi.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/forceatlas2-the-new-version-of-our-home-brew-layout/">The ForceAtlas 2 layout</a> is a way of representing data available on Gephi. I chose this representation technique because it kept the relative distance of the nodes at a manageable length, while still effectively visualizing relation strengths between subreddits spatially.</p>
<p>On the right side of the graph, we see our hardcore genres and their derivatives. <a href="http://reddit.com/r/metalcore">/r/metalcore</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/posthardcore">/r/posthardcore</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/melodichardcore">/r/melodichardcore</a>, and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/deathcore">/r/deathcore</a> are all very strongly related. <a href="http://reddit.com/r/poppunkers">/r/poppunkers</a> also tends to share a lot of users with the 'core' genres, even though it is pretty different it terms of sound and style.</p>
<p>As we move up the graph counter clockwise, we transition more in to metal and it's derivatives. Right between the two we see <a href="http://reddit.com/r/progmetal">/r/progmetal</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/djent">/r/djent</a>, which take styles from both sides of the heavy music coin and add their own twist. If you haven't heard of djent, not a problem - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djent">you can read about it here</a>. Closer to the middle, we can see <a href="http://reddit.com/r/metal">/r/metal</a> serves as a central hub for a lot of genres - hardcore, punk, metal, dubstep, and hiphop.</p>
<p>Closer to the bottom, we see the cluster of electronic music subreddits. I couldn't tell you what the differences are between them myself, because I spend most of my time over on the right side of the graph in the hardcore music variants. <a href="http://reddit.com/r/electronicmusic">/r/electronicmusic</a> seems to be the center of the 'electronic music' hub, but there are 7 very closely related subreddits in that area.</p>
<p><a href="http://reddit.com/r/hiphopheads">/r/hiphopheads</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/rap">/r/rap</a>, and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/90shiphop">/r/90shiphop</a> are all spread out through the middle. This implies that not only do they not share a large amount of users with each other, they tend to share users with a large set of other genres unlike themselves (due to their central position).</p>

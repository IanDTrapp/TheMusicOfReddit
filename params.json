  "body": "# Part One - Associations Between Musical Subreddits\r\n \r\n## Introduction\r\nReddit has many musical subreddits, and I became curious as to which genres are most closely associated with each other. To figure this out, I wrote a Python script to fetch the top 30,000 posts from each of the following subreddits: \r\n\r\n* 90shiphop\r\n* alternativerock\r\n* ambientmusic\r\n* blackmetal\r\n* blues\r\n* chillmusic\r\n* chillstep\r\n* classical\r\n* classicalmusicclassicrock\r\n* country\r\n* deathcore\r\n* deathmetal\r\n* djent\r\n* dnb\r\n* doommetal\r\n* dubstep\r\n* edm\r\n* electrohouse\r\n* electronicmusic\r\n* electroswing\r\n* folk\r\n* funk\r\n* hardcore\r\n* hardstyle\r\n* hiphopheads\r\n* indie_rock\r\n* indiefolk\r\n* indieheads\r\n* jazz\r\n* melodichardcore\r\n* metal\r\n* metalcore\r\n* modernrockmusic\r\n* popheads\r\n* poppunkers\r\n* posthardcore\r\n* postmetal\r\n* postrock\r\n* powermetal\r\n* progmetal\r\n* progrockmusic\r\n* psybient\r\n* psychedelicrock\r\n* punk\r\n* rap\r\n* reggae\r\n* seashanties\r\n* ska\r\n* sludge\r\n* stonermetal\r\n* swinghouse\r\n* techno\r\n* trance\r\n* trap\r\n* triphop\r\n* tropicalhouse\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Methodology\r\n\r\nI parsed out the artist, song, and subreddit from each submission under the assumption that the posts were in \"Artist - Song\" format, cleaned up the data by removing extra characters such as '()' and '[]', making the strings uniform (trimming and conversion to lower case.) From there, I condensed like artists in to a Python dictionary with the format ['artist', [set of subreddits]]. I then iterated through all subreddit combinations and counted each connection, except for commutative comparisons (for example, pop compared to metal is the same thing as metal compared to pop) and obviously to comparisons to itself (metal wouldn't compare to metal.) After some trial and error, I made sure to output this to CSV in a way that could be directly imported in to Gephi.\r\n\r\nAfter importing the data, I messed around with a few visualization techniques and found the results very interesting. I've included two below: Yifan Hu proportional and Frutcherman Reingold.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Data\r\n\r\n### Fruchterman Reingold Layout\r\n\r\n![](http://svgur.com/s/6U)\r\n\r\n",
